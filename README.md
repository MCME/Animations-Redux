Stop motion animation by Marozzo

To do:
- add stop conditions for loop animations
- activate Always Active Triggers only when there is at least a player at Max render distance
- play all the loaded animations at tick 1 speed twice on startup to clean previously abrupted animations (server restart)
- automate clipboard storage command
- enable editing existing animations
- create an "animation test" command
- add a new "Lever trigger" (Maybe redstone signal trigger?)
- add a new "Button trigger" (Maybe redstone signal trigger?)
- Simple phisics bullet action
- Random duration notation on frame duration
